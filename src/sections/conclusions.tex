In this manuscript, we have provided and discussed polynomial identities in terms of central factorial number.
We started from literature overview including various forms and definitions of central factorial numbers
continuing with polynomial identities based on those definitions.
Finally,
all the results of this manuscript can be validated using supplementary
Mathematica programs at~\cite{kolosov2023polynomial}.
