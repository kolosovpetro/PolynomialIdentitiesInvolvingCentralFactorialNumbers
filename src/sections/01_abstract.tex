Central factorial numbers appear in mathematical literature quite frequently.
Few of prominent works are Riordan's ``Combinatorial identities'' and Knuth's ``Johann Faulhaber and sums of powers''
along as many others.
In this manuscript, we start our discussion from the definition of central factorial numbers (both, recursive and iterative)
continuing with a set of identities shown further in this manuscript.
Afterward, based on odd-power identities given by Knuth,
we show new variations of odd-power identities applying certain relations in terms of central factorial numbers.
Finally, we provide a comprehensive way to validate the results of the manuscript via supplementary Mathematica programs.
