Central factorial numbers quietly often appear in literature, like for instance, in Riordan's
Combinatorial identities~\cite{riordan1968combinatorial}
\begin{equation*}
    T(n,k) = \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{j=0}^{k} \binom{k}{j} (-1)^{j} \left( \frac{1}{2}k - j \right)^{n}
\end{equation*}
Also, the book~\cite{carlitz_riordan_1963} references central factorial numbers as
\begin{equation*}
    K_{rs} = \frac{1}{(2s)!} \sum_{t=0}^{2s} (-1)^t \binom{2s}{t} (s-t)^{2r+2}
\end{equation*}
D. E. Knuth gives the following recurrence for the central factorial numbers~\cite{knuth1993johann}
\begin{equation*}
    T(2m+2, 2k) = k^2 T(2m,2k) + T(2m, 2k - 2)
\end{equation*}
In The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, central factorial numbers appear to be defined
via the following recurrence
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{cases}
        T(n,1) &=1 \\
        T(n,n) &=1 \\
        T(n,k) &=T(n-1, k-1) + k^2 T(n-1, k)
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
It is important to note that central factorial numbers are closely related to the central difference operator $\delta$,
Newton interpolation formula and central factorials $\centralFactorial{x}{n}$ and could be derived respectively.
The derivation of central factorial numbers by means of central difference operator $\delta$,
Newton interpolation formula and central factorials $\centralFactorial{x}{n}$
is shown at~\cite{scheuer2020mathstackexchange}.
So there are few central factorial numbers identities at our disposal.
The first is
\begin{equation}
(2k-1)
    !T(2n,2k) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=0}^{k} (-1)^j \binom{2k}{j} (k-j)^{2n}\label{eq:cfn-identity-1}
\end{equation}
Such that it is derived from the formula given by the~\cite{kolosov2018coefficients}, that is
\begin{equation*}
    A303675(n,k) = \frac{1}{n-k+1} \sum_{j=0}^{n-k+1} (-1)^{j} \binom{2[n-k+1]}{j} ([n-k+1]-j)^{2n}
\end{equation*}
Note that the term $n-k+1$ is given only to serve proper sequence offset and can be replaced easily by iterator $k$
so that we have arrived to the identity~\eqref{eq:cfn-identity-1}.
The second identity is actively used in current manuscript is that
\begin{equation}
(2k-1)
    !T(2n,2k) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=0}^{k} (-1)^{k-j} \binom{2k}{k-j} j^{2n}\label{eq:cfn-identity-2}
\end{equation}
and it is derived from~\eqref{eq:cfn-identity-1} by means
of symmetry of binomial coefficients $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$.
