# Polynomial identities involving Central Factorial numbers

Central factorial numbers appear in literature frequently, for instance in Riordan's Combinatorial identities, Knuth's
Johann Faulhaber and Sums of Powers and many others. In this manuscript, we start our discussion from the definition of
central factorial numbers (both, recursive and iterative), continuing with a set of identities used further in this
manuscript. Then, based on odd power identities given by Knuth, we show other variations of odd power identities
applying derived previously identities in terms of central factorial numbers.
